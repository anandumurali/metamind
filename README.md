## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you have a `package.json` file for frontend dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run Migrations**

   Apply the database migrations to set up your database schema:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**

   If you want to access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

6. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the server is running. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view your application.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

To access the Django admin panel, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier.
